## Description

The project is split into two parts:
1. [The Simple Frontend](/client) A basic React client web application which consumes the Todo RestAPI Backend. 
2. [The RestAPI Todo Backend](/backend), a Serverless powered Todo RestAPI Backend.

## Getting Setup

> _tip_: this frontend is designed to work with the RestAPI backends). It is recommended you stand up the backend first, test using Postman, and then the frontend should integrate.

### Installing Node and NPM
